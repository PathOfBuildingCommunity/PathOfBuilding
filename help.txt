---[Other Notable Things]

Adding ^ and then a number or hex code before text will change the colour of the text, eg ^^77 will make the following text white until the next colour marker is set.

---[Timeless Jewels]

Timeless jewels modify nodes in a radius based on their seed, the same seed will apply the same changes to the same small/notable nodes so that is the number you look for. The Conqueror (name on the jewel) only affects the keystone.

Path of Building has an inbuilt tool in the tree tab to search through seeds to find stats that would be good for your build.
Clicking the "Find Timeless Jewel" button on the bottom bar in the tree tab will open a UI that lets you:
Select which jewel type, which jewel socket to search for, and which conqueror from that jewel
    ("Any" will just use the first conqueror if you add it to build, more on that later)

The filter nodes option makes it only check nodes that are allocated when searching a jewel socket.
Next, a node change/addition can be selected with the "search for node" dropdown, 
    The values for the stats added are controlled by primary/secondary (in the case of 2 stats from 1 node) node weights
    If that type has already been added, then moving those sliders will change the values
    These values can also be edited directly in the "Desired Nodes" box
    A minimum weight can be added for a node. This will filter results to only seeds with at least that much weight from those nodes.
    If the minimum weight bar is at max, it will turn it into "required", this just means the node needs to show up at least once

There are 2 different boxes these weights can be entered into, a basic one, and the "fallback" weights.
    If a node is in both it will only use the value from desired. The fallback weights can automatically be populated by using
    the fallback weight mode, selecting a method of determining the weights (a stat to sort by) and clicking generate.
    These can then be copied from the fallback nodes box to the desired nodes box if you want to generate a different type
        eg. If you want to sort by combined dps and ehp, you generate one, copy it over and then generate the other

Lastly is the search results box. This will list seeds from the best to the worst based on your search parameters.
    Double-clicking one will add the jewel with that seed and keystone to your build.
    Clicking "Copy Trade URL" will copy a few results to a trade link which can be pasted into your browser.
    Doing this multiple times will copy later results in case the first one didn't show results.
    If you click 1 result and shift-click another it will highlight multiple, you can then click "Copy trade URL" to search all of them

Militant Faith jewels also have the option to select the other mods on the jewel

Advanced tricks:
    For Militant Faith, if you don't want any nodes to change, you can just sort by devotion. As unchanged nodes add devotion, the ones with the most devotion will be the ones with unchanged nodes
	
---[Party Tab]

The Party tab Allows you to import support characters and have their auras and curses apply

To import a build it must be exported with "Export support" enabled in the import/export tab and must be imported in the party tab
You can import a specific type like aura or curse, or import to all
You can also set it to append to a section rather than replace it (curses and links are always replaced if new one has a curse/link)
 
This does not add the auras, curses or links into the skills tab, but they do show up on calcs tab under "aura and buff skills" as well as "curses and debuffs" respectively
They also show other effects they add, like when physical damage reduction is applied by an aurabot with the Guardian node
 
Auras with the highest effect will take priority
Your curses will take priority over a support's

Links skills use stats from party members if they are exported
Some Enemy conditions and Modifiers may not be properly exported, please let us know if something is broken
Some auras like Mines which use a stack value for their effect will not apply as their stack value is missing

---[Skills Tab]

The skills tab allows you to plan out the skills you will use for your character. To access this tab, click on "Skills" in the tab at the top left of the screen next to "Tree" and "Items".

From here, you can view all of the skills in your build. There are a few different UI elements that you can use to group your skills and make DPS calculations easier. 

The top left window lets you view Socket Groups. Skills can be organized into Socket Groups to show which support gems are applied to certain skills. You can add a socket group by clicking New and selecting a skill from the drop-down. 
For example, you could add a socket group for Vitality and then attach Arrogance to the group as a support.
You can also add labels and organize your skills by type (auras, mobility, damage, etc). This is a great way to keep track of skill changes across skill sets as you level.

Skill sets can be thought of as collections of socket groups. There is a select box above the socket groups window that will let you switch between them. 
A great way to use these is to create skill sets for different level gaps, allowing you to plan out which skills you can run at certain points in your levelling progression.
They are also a nice way to showcase different skill options for your build. One set could show the skills you run to maximize DPS, while another could show a better setup for survivability or maybe mapping. Click Manage next to the select box to add, remove, rename, and copy skill sets.

If you click on a skill in one of your socket groups, a table will appear on the right showing you the details of that group. You can set which piece of gear the skills are socketed in, as well as the level of each skill, the variant, quality, and count. 
Hovering over a skill will display a full description of that skill and toggling the "Enabled" checkbox will enable or disable that skill from your build. You can also use the "Include in Full DPS" checkbox to include or exclude that skill from the Full DPS calculation displayed on the left panel. 
This can be useful for seeing how much damage you are getting from specific skills as well as specific groups of skills in your gear. You may also want to make a socket group simply for display purposes and then you can exclude that from DPS calculations.

Finally, underneath the Socket Groups window is the Gem Options box. This will let you configure the level of your skills gems as well as sort them by different types of DPS. Really useful for viewing total potential damage vs damage at different levels.


---[Items Tab]

The Item Tab in Path of Building allows you to plan out the gear you will use for your character. To access the Item Tab, click on the "Items" tab located at the top of the screen.

From here, you can view all of the gear slots for your character, such as your weapon, chest armour, and boots. To add an item to a slot, click on the arrow button on the right side of the slot. This will bring up a list of all the items available in your build, which are visible in the "All items" window.
If you wish to add more items, you can copy and paste items using CTRL+C (from the game or trade website) and CTRL+V into the "Shared items" window. Additionally, you can craft items using the "Craft item..." button on the top or create completely customizable items using the "Create custom..." option.

The item sets section located at the top of the screen can be used to save multiple sets of items and easily switch between them. You can add, remove, rename, and copy new sets using the "Manage..." button.

If you want to search for item upgrades, you can use the "Trade for these items" button to quickly search for items that can improve your gear.
