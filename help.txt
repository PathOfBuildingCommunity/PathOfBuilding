---[Timeless Jewels][6]

Timeless jewels modify nodes in a radius based off their seed, the same seed will apply the same changes to the same 
    small/notable nodes so that is the number you look for. The Conqueror (name on the jewel) only affects the keystone.
  
Path of Building has an inbuilt tool in the tree tab to search through seeds to find stats that would be good for your build.
Clicking the "Find Timeless Jewel" button on the bottom bar in the tree tab will open a UI that lets you:
Select which jewel type, which jewel socket to search for, and which conqueror from that jewel 
    ("Any" will just use the first conqueror if you add it to build, more on that later)

The filter nodes option makes it only check nodes that are allocated when searching a jewel socket.
Next, a node change/addition can be selected with the "search for node" dropdown, 
    The values for the stats added are controlled by primary/secondary (in the case of 2 stats from 1 node) node weights
    If that type has already been added, then moving those sliders will change the values
    These values can also be edited directly in the "Desired Nodes" box
    A minimum weight can be added for a node. This will filter results to only seeds with at least that much weight from those nodes.
    If the minimum weight bar is at max, it will turn it into "required", this just means the node needs to show up at least once

There are 2 different boxes these weights can be entered into, a basic one, and the "fallback" weights.
    If a node is in both it will only use the value from desired. The fallback weights can automatically be populated by using
    the fallback weight mode, selecting a method of determining the weights (a stat to sort by) and clicking generate.
    These can then be copied from the fallback nodes box to the desired nodes box if you want to generate a different type
        eg. If you want to sort by combined dps and ehp, you generate one, copy it over and then generate the other

Lastly is the search results box. This will list seeds from the best to the worst based on your search parameters.
    Double-clicking one will add the jewel with that seed and keystone to your build.
    Clicking "Copy Trade URL" will copy a few results to a trade link which can be pasted into your browser.
    Doing this multiple times will copy later results in case the first one didn't show results.
    If you click 1 result and shift-click another it will highlight multiple, you can then click "Copy trade URL" to search all of them

Militant Faith jewels also have the option to select the other mods on the jewel

Advanced tricks:
    For Militant Faith, if you don't want any nodes to change, you can just sort by devotion, as unchanged nodes add devotion the ones
    with the most devotion will be the ones with unchanged nodes
