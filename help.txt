Adding ^ and then a number or hex code before text will change the colour of the text, eg ^^77 will make the following text white until the next colour marker is set.

---[Timeless Jewels][6]

Timeless jewels modify nodes in a radius based off their seed, the same seed will apply the same changes to the same small/notable nodes so that is the number you look for. The Conqueror (name on the jewel) only affects the keystone.

Path of Building has an inbuilt tool in the tree tab to search through seeds to find stats that would be good for your build.
Clicking the "Find Timeless Jewel" button on the bottom bar in the tree tab will open a UI that lets you:
Select which jewel type, which jewel socket to search for, and which conqueror from that jewel
    ("Any" will just use the first conqueror if you add it to build, more on that later)

The filter nodes option makes it only check nodes that are allocated when searching a jewel socket.
Next, a node change/addition can be selected with the "search for node" dropdown, 
    The values for the stats added are controlled by primary/secondary (in the case of 2 stats from 1 node) node weights
    If that type has already been added, then moving those sliders will change the values
    These values can also be edited directly in the "Desired Nodes" box
    A minimum weight can be added for a node. This will filter results to only seeds with at least that much weight from those nodes.
    If the minimum weight bar is at max, it will turn it into "required", this just means the node needs to show up at least once

There are 2 different boxes these weights can be entered into, a basic one, and the "fallback" weights.
    If a node is in both it will only use the value from desired. The fallback weights can automatically be populated by using
    the fallback weight mode, selecting a method of determining the weights (a stat to sort by) and clicking generate.
    These can then be copied from the fallback nodes box to the desired nodes box if you want to generate a different type
        eg. If you want to sort by combined dps and ehp, you generate one, copy it over and then generate the other

Lastly is the search results box. This will list seeds from the best to the worst based on your search parameters.
    Double-clicking one will add the jewel with that seed and keystone to your build.
    Clicking "Copy Trade URL" will copy a few results to a trade link which can be pasted into your browser.
    Doing this multiple times will copy later results in case the first one didn't show results.
    If you click 1 result and shift-click another it will highlight multiple, you can then click "Copy trade URL" to search all of them

Militant Faith jewels also have the option to select the other mods on the jewel

Advanced tricks:
    For Militant Faith, if you don't want any nodes to change, you can just sort by devotion. As unchanged nodes add devotion, the ones with the most devotion will be the ones with unchanged nodes
	
---[Party Tab][7]

The Party tab Allows you to import support characters and have thier auras and curses apply

To import a build it must be exported with "Export support" enabled in the import/export tab and must be imported in the party tab
You can import a specific type like aura or curse, or import to all
You can also set it to append to a section rather than replacing it (currently curses must be replaced if not empty due to more curse limits not working well)
 
This does not add the auras or curses into the skills tab, but they do show up on calcs tab under "aura and buff skills" as well as "curses and debuffs" respectivly
They also show other effects they add, like when physical damage reduction is applied by an aurabot with the gaurdian node
 
Only the highest aura will apply, so if you and the support both run the same aura and your % inc effect is higher it will apply (even if the actual amount yours gives is lower due to gem levels or whatever), this is how it works ingame
Your curses will always apply before the supports though, so even if theres is a higher effect yours will be applied instead
 
For now Enemy conditions and Modifiers are not exported but can be imported if its saved in the XML, and Links skills are not exported or parsed
Some auras like Mines which use a stack value for thier effect will not apply as their stack value is missing
 
Advanced info:
    The format for the data is the name of the skill, the %increased effect and then the mods that are applied
    The mods are done similar to the style from modlib, where it the value applied, the "source" of the mod, the modname, the type added (eg base/inc), the flags, the keywordflags, and then any other tags
DEV[    The mods are done by modlib using modLib.formatModParams(mod)]
