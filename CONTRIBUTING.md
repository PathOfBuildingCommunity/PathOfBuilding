## Reporting bugs

### Before creating an issue:
* Check that the bug hasn't been reported in an existing issue. View similar issues to the left of the submit button.
* Make sure you are running the latest version of the program. Click "Check for Update" in the bottom left corner.
* If you've found an issue with offence or defence calculations, make sure you check the breakdown for that calculation in the Calcs tab to see how it is being performed, as this may help you find the cause.

### When creating an issue:
* Select the "Bug Report" issue template and fill out all fields.
* Please provide detailed instructions on how to reproduce the bug, if possible.
* Provide a build share code for a build that is affected by the bug, if possible.
  In the "Import/Export Build" tab, click "Generate", then "Share" and add the link to your post. 
  
Build share codes allow us to reproduce bugs much more quickly. 

## Requesting features
Feature requests are always welcome. Note that not all requests will receive an immediate response.

### Before submitting a feature request:
* Check that the feature hasn't already been requested. Look at all issues with titles that might be related to the feature.
* Make sure you are running the latest version of the program, as the feature may already have been added. Click "Check for Update" in the bottom left corner.

### When submitting a feature request:
* Select the "Feature Request" issue template and fill out all fields.
* Be specific! The more details, the better.
* Small requests are fine, even if it's just adding support for a minor modifier on a rarely-used unique.

## Contributing code

### Before submitting a pull request:
* Familiarise yourself with the code base [here](docs/rundown.md) to get you started.
* There is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) server for **active development** on the fork and members are happy to answer your questions there.
  If you are interested in joining, send a private message to any of **Cinnabarit#1341**, **LocalIdentity#9871**, **Yamin#5575** and we'll send you an invitation.

### When submitting a pull request:
* **Pull requests must be created against the `dev` branch**, as all changes to the code are staged there before merging to `master`.
* Make sure that the changes have been thoroughly tested!
* Make sure not to commit `./src/Data/ModCache.lua`. This is a very large, automatically generated file that is updated in the repository for releases only.
* There are many more files in the `./src/Data` directory that are automatically generated. This is indicated by the header 
  `-- This file is automatically generated, do not edit!`. To change these, instead change the scripts in the `./src/Export` directory and rerun the exporter.
  For your PR, please include all relevant changes to both the scripts and data files.

## Setting up a development installation
Note: This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with Git.

The easiest way to make and test changes is by setting up a development installation, in which the program runs directly from a local copy of the repository:

1. Clone the repository using this command:

       git clone -b dev https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding.git
2. Start Path of Building from the repository by running `./runtime/Path{space}of{space}Building.exe`.

You can now use the shortcut to run the program from the repository. Running the program in this manner automatically enables "Dev Mode", which has some handy debugging feature:
* `F5` restarts the program in-place (this is what usually happens when an update is applied).
* `Ctrl` + `~` toggles the console (Note that this does not work with all keyboard layouts. US layout is a safe bet though).
* `ConPrintf()` can be used to output to the console. Search for "===" in the project files if you want to get rid of the default debugging strings.
* Holding `Alt` adds additional debugging information to tooltips:
  * Items and passives show all internal modifiers that they are granting.
  * Stats that aren't parsed correctly will show any unrecognised parts of the stat description.
  * Passives also show node ID and node power values.
  * Conditional options in the Configuration tab show the list of dependent modifiers.
* While in the Tree tab, holding `Alt` also highlights nodes that have unrecognised modifiers.
* Holding `Ctrl` while launching the program will rebuild the mod cache.

Note that automatic updates are disabled in Dev Mode.

### Forcing Dev Mode OFF when using dev branch

Sometimes you may need to force Dev mode OFF when running from the dev branch to debug a specific part of Path of Building (e.g. the update system).

To do so [comment out Line 54 to line 58](./src/Launch.lua#L54-L58) of the [Launch.lua](./src/Launch.lua) file:
```
	--if localManXML and not self.versionBranch and not self.versionPlatform then
	--    -- Looks like a remote manifest, so we're probably running from a repository
	--    -- Enable dev mode to disable updates and set user path to be the script path
	--    self.devMode = true
	--end
```

and create a valid manifest.xml file in the ./src directory. Then run the `./runtime/Path{space}of{space}Building.exe` as usual. You should get the typical update popup in the bottom left corner.

The manifest.xml file deserves its own in depth document, but usually copying from release and editing accordingly works well enough.

## Keeping your fork up to date

Note: This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with Git and basic command line tools.

Note: If you've configured a remote already, you can skip ahead to step 3.

1. Add a new remote repository and name it `upstream`.

       git remote add upstream https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding.git
2. Verify that adding the remote worked.

       git remote -v
3. Fetch all branches and their commits from upstream.

       git fetch upstream
4. Check out your local `dev` branch if you haven't already.

       git checkout dev
5. Merge all changes from `upstream/dev` into your local `dev` branch.

       git rebase upstream/dev
6. Push your updated branch to GitHub.

       git push -f origin dev

## Setting up a development environment

Note: This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with the development tool of your choice.

If you want to use a text editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (proprietary) is recommended.
If you want to use an IDE instead, [PyCharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [IntelliJ Idea Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (open source) are recommended.
They are all free and support [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua), a Lua plugin that comes with a language server, debugger and many pleasant features.
It is recommended to use it over the built-in Lua plugins.

Please note that EmmyLua is not available for other editors based on Visual Studio Code,
such as [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) or [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org) but can be built from source if needed.

Note that you will need to have [Java](https://www.java.com/) installed to use emmyLua, and have either the JAVA_HOME environment variable correctly set up or have the path to java added to the `settings.json` file. Example:

```"emmylua.java.home": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jre1.8.0_201/"```

To do this in VSCode find the Java installation folder on your computer as displayed above.
1. Navigate to extensions inside VSCode
2. Click the cog icon next to EmmyLua -> Extension Settings
3. Find "Java: Home" -> Edit settings
4. Place the directory address between the quotes
5. File -> Save


### Visual Studio Code

1. Create a new "Debug Configuration" of type "EmmyLua New Debug"
2. Open the Visual Studio Code extensions folder. On Windows, this defaults to `%USERPROFILE%/.vscode/extensions`.
3. Find the sub-folder that contains `emmy_core.dll`. You should find both x86 and x64; pick x86. For example, `C:/Users/someuser/.vscode/extensions/tangzx.emmylua-0.3.28/debugger/emmy/windows/x86`.
4. Paste the following code snippet directly below `function launch:OnInit()` in `./src/Launch.lua`:
  ```lua
-- This is the path to emmy_core.dll. The ?.dll at the end is intentional.
package.cpath = package.cpath .. ";C:/Users/someuser/.vscode/extensions/tangzx.emmylua-0.3.28/debugger/emmy/windows/x86/?.dll"
local dbg = require("emmy_core")
-- This port must match the Visual Studio Code configuration. Default is 9966.
dbg.tcpListen("localhost", 9966)
-- Uncomment the next line if you want Path of Building to block until the debugger is attached
--dbg.waitIDE()
  ```
5. Start Path of Building Community
6. Attach the debugger

#### Excluding directories from emmyLua

Depending on the amount of system ram you have available and the amount that gets assigned to the jvm running the emmylua language server you might run into issues when trying to debug Path of building.
Files in /Data /Export and /TreeData can be massive and cause the emmyLua language server to use a significant amount of memory. Sometimes causing the language server to crash. To avoid this and speed up initialization consider adding an `emmy.config.json` file to the .vscode folder in the root of the Path of building repository with the following content:

```
{
    "source": [
        {
            "dir": "../",
            "exclude": [
                "src/Export/**.lua",
                "src/Data/**.lua",
                "src/TreeData/**.lua"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### PyCharm Community / IntelliJ Idea Community

1. Create a new "Debug Configuration" of type "Emmy Debugger(NEW)".
2. Select "x86" version.
3. Select if you want the program to block (checkbox) until you attached the debugger (useful if you have to debug the startup process).
4. Copy the generated code snippet directly below `function launch:OnInit()` in `./src/Launch.lua`.
5. Start Path of Building Community
6. Attach the debugger

#### Miscellaneous tips
If you're on windows, consider downloading [git for windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and installing git bash. Git bash comes with a variety of typical linux tools such as grep that can make navigating the code base much easier.

If you're using linux you can run the ./runtime/Path{space}of{space}Building.exe executable with wine. You will need to provide a valid wine path to the emmy lua debugger directory.


## Testing

PoB uses the [Busted](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/) framework to run its tests.  Tests are stored under `spec/System` and run automatically when a PR is modified.
More tests can be added to this folder to test specific functionality, or new test builds can be added to ensure nothing changed that wasn't intended. 

### Running tests
1. Install [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/)
2. Run `luarocks install busted`
3. Run `busted --lua=luajit` from the command line.  You may need to add `luajit` to your PATH

Docker alternative:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` from the command line
3. View last results in `spec/test_results.log`

### Creating new test builds or fixing an existing build

Sometimes a change will be made that intends to change the stats garnered by PoB, which will break our tests.
1. Add the new build XML (if applicable) to the `TestBuilds` folder
2. Run `busted --lua=luajit -r generate` to generate a LUA file that contains the current stats of that build
3. Run `busted --lua=luajit` and the tests should pass

Docker alternative:

1. Add the new build XML (if applicable) to the `TestBuilds` folder
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to generate a LUA file that contains the current stats of that build and run the tests

## Exporting GGPK data from Path of Exile

Note: This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with the GGPK and its structure. [poe-tool-dev/ggpk.discussion](https://github.com/poe-tool-dev/ggpk.discussion/wiki)
is a good starting point.

The `./src/Data` folder contains generated files which are created using the scripts in the `./src/Export/Scripts` folder based on Path of Exile game data. 
If you change any logic/configuration in `./src/Export`, you will need to regenerate the appropriate `./src/Data` files. You can do so by running the `./src/Export` scripts using the `.dat` viewer at `./src/Export/Launch.lua`:

### Obtain an Oodle extractor
Note: For this tutorial, you will need a working installation of [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
as well as some familiarity with build tools such as [CMake](https://cmake.org).
1. In Visual Studio, clone the following repository using this command:

        git clone -b master https://github.com/zao/ooz
2. Configure CMake.
3. Build `bun_extract_file.exe`, `libbun.dll` and `libooz.dll`.

### Set up the exporter   
1. Copy `bun_extract_file.exe`, `libbun.dll` and `libooz.dll` to `./src/Export/ggpk/`.
2. Create a shortcut to `./runtime/Path{space}of{space}Building.exe` with the path to `./src/Export/Launch.lua` as first argument. You should end up with something like: `"<path to repo>\runtime\Path{space}of{space}Building.exe" "<path to repo>\src\Export\Launch.lua"`.
3. Run the shortcut, and the GGPK data viewer UI will appear. If you get an error, be sure you're using the latest release of Path of Building Community.
4. Paste the path to `Content.ggpk` (or, for Steam users, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile`) into the text box in the top left, and hit `Enter` to read the GGPK. If successful, you will see a list of the data tables in the GGPK file. Note: This will not work on the GGPK from the torrent file released before league launches, as it contains no `Data` section.
5. Click `Scripts >>` to show the list of available export scripts. Double-clicking a script will run it, and the box to the right will show any output from the script.
6. If you run into any errors, update the code in `./src/Export` as necessary and try again.
